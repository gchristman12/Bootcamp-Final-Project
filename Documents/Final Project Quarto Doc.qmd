## Data Description

This document features a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The dataset includes basic descriptive data on all athletes and medal results from their games.

## gtsummary table

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(gtsummary)

athletes <- read_csv(here::here("Data","athlete_events.csv"))

table1 <- tbl_summary(
	athletes,
	by = Season,
	include = c(Sex, Age, Height))

#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "Descriptive Statistics on Athletes"
knitr::kable(table1)
```

You can add options to executable code like this
